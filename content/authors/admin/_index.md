Hello! I am a biostatistician and R developer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the Department of Biostatistics in Nashville, TN. My primary collaboration is with the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimerâ€™s Center, a talented team of clinicians and scientists committed to uncovering how cardiovascular health affects Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline in older adults. I use the R programming language to conduct statistical analyses for this group that employ a modern approach--common methods include mixed-effects regression models, nonparametric bootstrap resampling, and mediation analysis. R is a great tool for me to use because:
 - it is easy to mix R code with Markdown, $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$, and JavaScript which I use to create good-looking, reproducible, interactive reports;
 - it has an active community of developers committed to improving R's functionality that I am proud to be a part of;
 - it is a functional programming language, which means it has referential transparency, allows lazy evaluation, and is easy to read and debug;
 - it is free and open-source;
 - and because it is fun to use.
 
In addition to using R for statistical analyses, I create software tools that help address unique challenges that arise in the collaboration between statisticians and other scientists. Examples of this include a research package that automates the highly complex quarterly downloading, processing, derivation, validation, and version control of a master dataset; a package that allows the user to create a codebook to accompany the sharing of a dataset; and a web app that allows users to perform basic exploratory data analysis without needing to write any code or submit a statistical request.

Outside of my work, I like to study foreign languages, cook food, and play video games. Please feel free to shoot me an email if you would like to chat!
