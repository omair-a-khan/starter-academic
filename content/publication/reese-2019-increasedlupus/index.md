abstract: "
**Background:** Blood pressure visit-to-visit variability is a novel risk factor for deleterious long-term cardiac and renal outcomes in the general population. We hypothesized that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have greater blood pressure visit-to-visit variability than control subjects and that blood pressure visit-to-visit variability is associated with a higher comorbidity burden. <br /><br />

**Methods:** We studied 899 patients with SLE and 4172 matched controls using de-identified electronic health records from an academic medical center. We compared blood pressure visit-to-visit variability measures in patients with SLE and control subjects and examined the association between blood pressure visit-to-visit variability and patients’ characteristics. <br /><br />

**Results:** Patients with SLE had higher systolic blood pressure visit-to-visit variability 9.7% (7.8–11.8%) than the control group 9.2% (7.4–11.2%), P < 0.001 by coefficient of variation. Additional measures of systolic blood pressure visit-to-visit variability (i.e. standard deviation, average real variation, successive variation and maximum measure-to-measure change) were also significantly higher in patients with SLE than in control subjects. In patients with SLE, blood pressure visit-to-visit variability correlated significantly with age, creatinine, CRP, triglyceride concentrations and the Charlson comorbidity score (all P < 0.05). Hydroxychloroquine use was associated with reduced blood pressure visit-to-visit variability (P < 0.001), whereas the use of antihypertensives, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids was associated with increased blood pressure visit-to-visit variability (P < .05). <br /><br />

**Conclusion:** Patients with SLE had higher blood pressure visit-to-visit variability than controls, and this increased blood pressure visit-to-visit variability was associated with greater Charlson comorbidity scores, several clinical characteristics and immunosuppressant medications. In particular, hydroxychloroquine prescription was associated with lower blood pressure visit-to-visit variability.
