Hello! I am a biostatistician and R developer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the Department of Biostatistics in Nashville, TN. My primary collaboration is with the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimerâ€™s Center (VMAC), a talented team of clinicians and scientists committed to uncovering how cardiovascular health affects Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline in older adults. I use the R programming language to conduct statistical analyses for this group that employ a modern approach--common methods include mixed-effects regression models, nonparametric bootstrap resampling, and mediation analysis. R is a great tool to use because:
 - it has an active community of developers, committed to improving R's functionality;
 - it is easy to mix R code with Markdown, $\LaTeX$, and JavaScript which I use to create good-looking, reproducible, interactive reports and web apps;
 - it is free and open-source;
 - it is a functional programming language, which means it has referential transparency, allows lazy evaluation, and is easy to read and debug;
 - and because it is fun to use.

When I'm not coding, I like to study foreign languages, cook delicious food, and play video games.
