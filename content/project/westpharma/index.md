<h3>1. A Practical Guide to Utilizing $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$</h3>

This document explains the use of process capability indices as a way to understand and improve manufacturing processes. It is intended to be an empirical and pragmatic approach to capability analysis without developing the underlying statistical theory. After reading this document, the reader will have a strong grasp on the motivation for process capability indices and what is needed to calculate them, focusing on $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$.

<h3>2. Confidence Intervals for Process Capability Indices</h3>

This document introduces the use of confidence intervals for process capability indices. We begin with a basic description of estimation followed by various equations for calculating the interval for $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$. The final section describes a custom developed web application to automate these calculations for West engineers.

<h3>3. Statistical Procedures for Inter-Rater Reliability</h3>

This document describes various statistical procedures for measuring inter-rater reliability. These methods quantify the homogeneity in ratings and can be used to show how well two methods of measurement agree.

<h3>4. Statistical Procedures for Testing Equivalence</h3>

This document covers procedures for testing the equality of two or more means including $t$-tests, one-way ANOVA, and post-hoc procedures.
