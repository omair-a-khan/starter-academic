Hello! I am a biostatistician and R developer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center Department of Biostatistics in Nashville, TN. My primary collaboration is with the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimerâ€™s Center, a talented team of clinicians and scientists who help advance the understanding of risk factors, early diagnostic markers, and prevention and treatment methods for memory loss and unhealthy cognitive aging. I am particularly interested in developing software tools to minimize the challenges associated with collaborations between statisticians and other scientists.

When I'm not coding, I like to study foreign languages, cook delicious food, and play video games.
